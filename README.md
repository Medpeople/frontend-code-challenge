# Welcome to the Medpeople frontend code challenge!

## INTRO
We’re glad that you’re considering joining our tech team – and we look forward to hearing more about you, deep-dive into technical discussions and connect on a personal level. After all, that’s what’s most important!

But first, we’d love to see some code. We believe that the way you approach this challenge, the choices you make and the things you focus on, will tell us much more about your skills and experience as a coder than the years you spent on the job or any programming course certificates.

And the challenge goes both ways: Not only will we learn something about you, you will also learn something about working at Medpeople – the technologies we’re using, the kind of data we’re dealing with and the kinds of problems we’re solving on a daily basis. Let's see how you like it!

At Medpeople, we develop three different apps inhouse:
- a mobile app, written in React Native, where healthcare professionals can apply for shifts, and manage their calendars and CVs
- a web app, written in React, where hospitals can post job openings and manage their schedules
- a web app, written in React, where our internal sales and customer success teams can manage and assist our users

## THE CHALLENGE
Here are two (simplified) screens from our mobile app, that we would like you to rebuild for this code challenge:

Job List Screen            Job Details Screen

In the `jobs.json` file you will find a list of jobs with all the necessary data. It’s up to you if you want to build a replica of the existing design or come up with a new and improved version! The **minimum requirements** are:
1. The Job List view should display a list of all provided jobs with the most essential information (it’s up to you to decide what that is)
2. Tapping a job should open the Job Details view
3. The Job Details view should display all available information about the selected job
4. It should be possible to navigate back from the Job Details view to the Job List view
5. Your app should work on either iOS or android, and it’s ok to develop and test it on just one specific device

Since our main focus and most of our programming time is spent on the mobile app, we want to challenge you to tackle this assignment with **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)**!

## YOUR SKILLS
If you’ve never worked with React Native before – no worries! Prior knowledge is not a requirement and we will consider this when assessing your code. We want you to focus on learning the required React Native basics to build a minimal version of the above features. It’s up to you to use as much or as little boilerplate code as you want, but to get you started quickly we can recommend [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client).

If you have React Native experience – awesome! Implementing the basic requirements should be an easy thing to do, and then it’s your chance to shine: Why not add some nice animations and transitions, if that’s your thing? Or how about you tackle those tricky horizontally scrollable lists from the original job list design? Maybe a filter would be a nice addition? Ooh, or tests? We love tested code. Or go with any other idea that showcases your personal strengths! It’s completely up to you what to focus on (just don’t try to do it all at once, or you’ll be busy for a week).

## THE FINE PRINT
Speaking of time: There is no time limit on this code challenge, but when we tested it in our team we were all able to produce a functioning and nice looking result within **3–5 hours**, so that’s about the time frame you can expect. You are, of course, free to spend as much or as little time as you want!

Once you’ve built something you’re happy with and that you think will convince us to hire you, please share it with us via Github (or similar). Make sure to also let us know which OS and device you tested it on, so we can use the same! We will then reach out to you with some feedback – and perhaps an invitation to a technical interview. If you have questions you can always reach us via [tech@medpeople.se](mailto:tech@medpeople.se).

Good luck, and enjoy the challenge!
